## Status
Readme.md being updated. There's still stuff I want to fix, like SVGs behaving really weird. Also, a lot of the commands are is sort of Mac-specific. I need to update those to plugins or something else. So, if you're on Windows, expect to hack at the `package.json` for a bit.

## Commands
- `yarn run dev` to do development and see bundle analysis
- `yarn build` to do a static build to the `dist` folder
